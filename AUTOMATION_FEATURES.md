# 🤖 Advanced Automation Features - Implementation Guide

## 🌟 New Features Overview

The Telegram Bot Manager has been enhanced with powerful automation capabilities that transform your bot from a simple message handler into a sophisticated automated assistant.

## 🔥 Auto-Reply System

### Core Functionality
- **Intelligent Pattern Matching**: 4 different matching algorithms for flexible response triggers
- **Real-Time Processing**: Instant responses when users send matching messages
- **Rule Management**: Create, edit, enable/disable, and delete auto-reply rules
- **Conversation Flow**: Maintain natural conversation flow with automated responses

### Matching Types Explained

1. **Exact Match** (`exact`)
   - Responds only when message exactly equals the keyword
   - Example: "help" triggers only when user sends exactly "help"
   - Use case: Specific command responses

2. **Contains Match** (`contains`)
   - Responds when message contains the keyword anywhere
   - Example: "hello" triggers for "hello there", "say hello", etc.
   - Use case: Greeting detection, common word responses

3. **Starts With** (`starts_with`)
   - Responds when message begins with the keyword
   - Example: "/order" triggers for "/order pizza", "/order info", etc.
   - Use case: Command prefixes, structured interactions

4. **Regex Match** (`regex`)
   - Advanced pattern matching using regular expressions
   - Example: `\b(hi|hey|hello)\b` for flexible greeting detection
   - Use case: Complex patterns, multiple variations

### Setup Example
```javascript
// Create auto-reply rule via API
{
  "keyword": "support",
  "response": "Hi! I'm here to help. Please describe your issue and I'll assist you right away! 🤝",
